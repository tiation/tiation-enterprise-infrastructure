# Enterprise Deployment Guide

## Deployment Options

### Single-Host Deployment

- **Ideal for**: Individual developers or small teams
- **Setup**:
  - Single VM per developer
  - Direct SSH access for easy management
  - Resource allocation based on individual needs

### Team Deployment

- **Ideal for**: Shared development environments
- **Setup**:
  - Shared VM infrastructure for cost efficiency
  - Role-based access control
  - Centralized logging and monitoring

### CI/CD Integration

- **Ideal for**: Automated container testing and deployment
- **Setup**:
  - Automated VM provisioning in CI/CD pipelines
  - Integration with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.
  - Automated container builds and tests

## Security Best Practices

### Network Isolation

- Run VMs in isolated network segments
- Restrict direct network access
- Use VPN for secure connections

### SSH Key Management

- Use key-based authentication
- Implement automated key rotation
- Regular access reviews

### Audit Logging

- Enable detailed logging of connections and operations
- Maintain logs for audit compliance
- Regular review of access logs

### Compliance

- SOC2 and HIPAA compliant configurations
- Regular compliance auditing
- Implement security policies and procedures

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Approach**: Add more VMs or containers as demand grows
- **Tools**: Docker Swarm, Kubernetes
- **Benefits**: Improved fault tolerance, scalability

### Vertical Scaling

- **Approach**: Increase resources of existing VMs
- **Tools**: Dynamic resource allocation
- **Benefits**: Cost efficiency, easy management

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Check VM status using `tdd-status`
   - Restart connection if necessary

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Review resource utilization
   - Consider scaling options

3. **Port Conflicts**
   - Use dynamic port allocation
   - Review active connections with `tdd-tunnel-list`

## Glossary

- **VM**: Virtual Machine
- **SSH**: Secure Shell
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **VPN**: Virtual Private Network
